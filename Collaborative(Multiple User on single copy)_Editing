What is Collaborative editing:
  Multiple users are working on same copy of text or RTF or painting or wireframes or whiteboards
  
E.g. Google docs

Problems with collaborative editors:
  . Same user can be adding/editing/deleting/reformatting a single line which other users are working on
  . Concurrency
  . Distributed or Latency issues 
  
Can we Use Lock to solve problem?
  No, it is turn basesd editing which will be endless wait
  As locks are pesimistic concurrency control

Alternates (Optimistic concurrency control):
  We think nothing will go wrong, we allow users to edit
  
  Example
    User 1 and 2 are working on One document, how do we sync both the document?
    
    Strategies:
      * Event based sync (create, delete, update, reformatting)  ------------- This is called Operational Transformation
        . Character by character sync                            ------------- This is called Differential Sync
        . Line by Line sync
      * Difference based sync (Get the difference perodically and send it to all the users working on document)
  
 Operation Transformation:
    At its core, is an optimistic concurrency control mechanism.
    It allows two editors/users to modify the same section of the document at sametime without conflicts
    or rather it provides a mechanism for sanely resolving those conflicts so that niether user intervention nor locking becomes necessary
  
  What are the operation performed in test editing:
    . Create
    . Insert
    . Update
    . Delete
    . change font, font size .... (advanced features)
