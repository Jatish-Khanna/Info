Issue with the existing systems?
  1 Limited scalability and availability, where as Kafka is built to scale and be available for the distributed systems
  2 Broker per scenario whereas Kafka provides topics and partitions to handle different sources and distributed systems
  3 Active passive clustering for the existing systems
  4 No backward compatibility with the existing messages and schema
  5 Downtime for maintenance, failures and system upgrades
  6 No backward compability or minimal with the servers and the clients
  7 Tight coupling via synchnoronous communication REST
  8 No handling of backpressure or unavailable consumers
