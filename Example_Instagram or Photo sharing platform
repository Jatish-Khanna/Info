Instagram?
  Instagram is a social networking service which enables its users to upload and share their photos and videos with other users.

 Anything shared publically can be seen by any other user, whereas privately shared contents can only be accessible by a specified set of people.


1) Functional requirements?
  . Upload/Download/View the photos' or videos
  . User can perform search based on photos or videos
  . User can connect with users
  . A feed from others users to be displayed
  
2) Non-functional requirement?
  . Availability
  . Low latency for file upload and news feed generation
  . Eventual consistency
  . The system should be reliable that any photo's/media upload should never be lost
  
 3) Design considerations - read/write heavy?
  The systems should be ready heavy as news feed will be shared will connections
  . User can upload as many as photos
 
4) Estimations:
  Assuming it has 1M active request per day
  1M photos have been shared every day i.e. 12 photos per second
  Average size of photos is 200 Kb
  
  
  A) Traffic estimations?
    
  B) Space estimations?
    1M * 200 Kb = 200 GB per day
    
    For 10 years
      200GB * 365 (days) * 10 = 712 TB 
    
  c) Bandwidth estimations?
  
  d) Memory estimations?
  


5) API definition?

6) Database design?
  a) Photo table - stores file path for distributed file store Amazon S3 and Id (Scalable - NoSql)
  b) User table - Relationship (MySQL or Columar database - casandara)
  c) Follower table - to store all the connections (MySQL or Columar database - casandara)

7) High level design?
  a) Upload a photo by user
  b) View/Search photo
