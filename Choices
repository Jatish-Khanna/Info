Logstash vs Elastic search

What about queueing and back-pressure?
When sending data to Elasticsearch, whether it is directly or via an ingest pipeline, 
every client needs to be able to handle the case when Elasticsearch is not able to keep up or accept more data
 This is what we refer to as applying back-pressure
 If the data nodes are not able to accept data, the ingest node will stop accepting data as well


Architectures where there is no queueing mechanism built into the processing pipeline, 
either at the source or along the way, have the potential to suffer from data loss in the case 
Elasticsearch is not reachable or able to accept data for an extended period
 This includes Beats that are not able to store and read data from file 
 as well as other processes able to write directly to Elasticsearch, eg
 syslog-ng


Logstash is able to queue data on disk using its persistent queues feature, 
allowing Logstash to  provide at-least once delivery guarantees and buffer data locally through ingestion spikes
 Logstash also supports integration with a number of different types of message queues, 
 which allows a wide variety of deployment patterns to be supported


---------------------------------
Redis datastructure? Why HashOperations over HashSet and KeyValue
  - Key/ value datastructure doesn't allow to perform operation, it treats data as String
  - HashSet: Store each, pair as individual Key/Value for particular model. So, GETALL is expensive operation
  - Hash: It collates the data as single Object, 
          It also allows to perform atomic operation on each data for the same Object
