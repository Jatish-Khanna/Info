Prometheus
Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system that was originally built by SoundCloud. It consists of the following core components -

A data scraper that pulls metrics data over HTTP periodically at a configured interval.

A time-series database to store all the metrics data.

A simple user interface where you can visualize, query, and monitor all the metrics.
