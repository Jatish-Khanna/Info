Artificial Intelligence - 
  the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, 
    such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.

computer vision is concerned with the theory and technology for building 
   artificial systems that obtain information from images or multi-dimensional data.

Machine learning is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that 
  computer systems use to effectively perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, 
  relying on patterns and inference instead. 
  It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence

Types of Machine Learning
  1) Supervised and Semi-supervised
   Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs
  
    Y(Output) - predicted values, dependent variables
    X(input) - predictors, independent variables
    
    Example - Regression algo. 
  
  2) Unsupervised
    Unsupervised learning algorithms take a set of data that contains only inputs, and find structure in the data, 
    like grouping or clustering of data points. The algorithms therefore learn from test data that has not been labeled, 
    classified or categorized. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities 
    in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. 
  
  Example - Classification
  
  3) Reinforcement learning
     Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents 
     ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.
