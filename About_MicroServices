Why API gateway?

An API Gateway is the element that coordinates and orchestrates how all the requests are processed in a Microservices architecture, and this also includes to the Serverless model.
 An API Gateway includes an HTTP server where routes are associated with a Microservice or with a FaaS function.
 When an API Gateway receives a request, it looks up for the Microservice which can serve the request and delivers it to the relevant part.
 It maps the request parameters to the input arguments of the service or function if necessary, in order to complete the start of the request.
 Then, it gets the result that the function got to the request into an HTTP response and returns it to the original caller.
