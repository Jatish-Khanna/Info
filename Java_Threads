Runnable interface
Thread class

class TProcess extends Thread {
  @Override
  public void run() {
  
  }
}

class TProcess implements Runnable {

  @Override
  public void run() {
  
  }
}


------------------
Keyword volatile-

  It prevents threads from assuming or reusing the cached value by JVM. 
  In case when threads doesn't modify the value which is externally modified but read by threads.
    A chance where stale or old value can be read by system
    
==================

Thread join method
  - pauses the execution of threads in which it has been called until it completes its execution
  
  Example-
  class TProcess extends Thread {
    private int count = 0;
    private synchronized int countSync = 0;
    
    @Override
    public void run {
    
      for(int index = 0; index <= 1000; index++) {
        count++;
        countSync++;
      }
    }
    
    public static void main(String []args) {
      TProcess t1 = new TProcess();
      TProcess t2 = new TProcess();
      
      t1.start();
      t2.start();
      
      // Unpredicted value - as start immidiatly returned after initiating new thread
      System.out.println("value of count: "+ count);
      
      // Pauses the main thread (the thread from where join has been called)
      // Waits until child completes execution
      try{
        t1.join();
        t2.join();
      } catch(InterruptedException e) {}
      // value of count may be = 2000 (because is not synchronized, so there may be posibility of bugs)
      System.out.println("value of count:" + count);
      // value of count will be = 2000
      System.out.println("value of count:" + countSync);
    }
  }
