Kafka connect is a data streaming platform
  This platforms interfaces Kafka with other systems

  Stream an entire SQL data from the database into Kafka
  Stream the entire topics into HDFS for analytics and processing
  Stream the data into Elastic Clusture for secondary indexing
  (CQRS -> Command query responsibility seggragation pattern for External search and queries)


Kafka Connect is using producer and Consumer API's and that automatic
  - COTS and deeply tested connect components are available for common data sources
  - Automatic loadbalancing for distributed systems
  - No "do it yourself" i.e. no external coding required
  - Easy use existing connectors and extensible for new features

The basic responsibility of Apache Connect to 
 - Trasfer data b/w Kafka and Other systems
 - Connectors recieve data from different channels into Kafka (ingress/source)
 - Connectors sends data to external systems (egress/sink)
