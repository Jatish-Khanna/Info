Overall, Google Docs does a pretty fantastic job of translating text to HTML. Here are some of the takeaways/inconsistencies that I noticed:

Headings are true: H1, H2, H3 translate well
“Title” in Docs creates an H1 heading in WordPress
“Subtitle” in Docs creates an H2 heading in WordPress
Bold, underline, italics, and strikethrough are translated perfectly from Docs to WordPress
Ordered and unordered lists translate true from Docs to WordPress
Text color, font type, and indentation do not translate from Docs to WordPress
Links from a document work fine in WordPress
There is no blockquote in Docs
