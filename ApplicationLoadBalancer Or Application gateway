Load balancer-  
  It operates at L3 (IP), L4 (TCP/UDP), L7 (Application Context)

Supports session affinity

Internet facing Loadbalancer:
  Maps the public IP of virtual n/w with the Private Ip's of virtual network
  It is bi-directional
  Request to and from VM is routed through LB
  
Internal LB:
  Within the internal n/w to balance traffic between two internal services
  To loadbalance traffic b/w data tier and business tier
  
  
  Benefits of LB:
    . Any kind of traffic across virtual n/w
    . Can route UDP/TCP or port forwarding
    . Direct server return for bandwidth intensive traffic
    . Allows tiered routing in N-Tier architecture
    . Helps to scale out the Virtual machine instances
    . Can be used to pool multiple public IP's
