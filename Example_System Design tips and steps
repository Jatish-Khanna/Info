Example of Capacity estimations
	1 Million request per day
	Reads/Write ratio - 5:1
	
	
	Traffic - Reads/Writes per second
	
	1 Million writes per day
	5 Million reads per day based on read:write ratio
	
	1M / (24 * 60 * 60) =  12 paste per second
	5M / (24 * 60 * 60) =  57 paste per second
	
	Storage estimations:
	user can upload max 10Mb of content but average 10Kb file is written by all the users
	
	1M * 10KB = 10 Gb per day
	
	To store this data for 10 years we need-
	1M per day * 365 days * 10 years= 36 TB
	
	If we shorten URL, we need another 6 characters for base64 encoding-
		64  pow 6 = 68.7 billion unique strings
	
	If it take 1 byte to store 1 character
		then total size required to store  3.6 billion keys (max request in 10 years)
		3.6B * 6 (characters per hash) = 22 GB
		
	To keep the margin 70% of space will be utilized of total
		36TB * .7 + 36 TB = 51 TB

	
	Bandwidth
	Ingress:
		10 Kb * 12 paste per second = 120 Kbper second
	
	Egress:
		10 Kb * 58 request per second = .6 Mbps
	

	Memory estimations for cache
		Following 80-20 rule i.e. 20% of hot paste generates 80% of traffic
		Caching 20% request
		
		5M reads per day * 10 Kb size per read * 0.2 (80-20 rule) = 10 Gb
	

Example of System API
	addPaste(api_dev_key, paste_data, custom_url=None user_name=None, paste_name=None, expire_date=None)
	Parameters:
api_dev_key (string): The API developer key of a registered account. 
This will be used to, among other things, throttle users based on their allocated quota.
paste_data (string): Textual data of the paste.
custom_url (string): Optional custom URL.
user_name (string): Optional user name to be used to generate URL.
paste_name (string): Optional name of the paste expire_date (string): Optional expiration date for the paste.

Returns: (string)
A successful insertion returns the URL through which the paste can be accessed, otherwise, returns an error code.

Similarly, we can have retrieve and delete Paste APIs:


getPaste(api_dev_key, api_paste_key)
Where “api_paste_key” is a string representing the Paste Key of the paste to be retrieved. This API will return the textual data of the paste.


deletePaste(api_dev_key, api_paste_key)
A successful deletion returns ‘true’, otherwise returns ‘false’.




Example of database design
	A few observations about the nature of the data we are going to store:

We need to store billions of records.
Each metadata object we are going to store would be small (less than 100 bytes).
Each paste object we are storing can be of medium size (it can be a few MB).
There are no relationships between records, except if we want to store which user created what Paste.
Our service is read-heavy.
Database Schema:
We would need two tables, one for storing information about the Pastes and the other for users’ data.


Here, ‘URlHash’ is the URL equivalent of the TinyURL and ‘ContentKey’ is the object key storing the contents of the paste.
