Design a news feed for a social networking website, which shows updates from the users in connections

1) What is news feed?
  It is a home timeline service which shows all the updates from users includes, there post, status, photos, video or any shared content
  Any social media system has timeline which shows the updates from it connecting users
  
  
2) Requirements?
  Functional requirements?
    . A news feed systems shows the data from users which have been connected
    . A user is related to multiple other persons, by connecting with them or following them
    . Feed may contains posts, images, videos,
    . It should append new feeds or recent feeds using server sent mechanism or long polling or pull method
    
  Non-Functional requirements?
    . System should be able to generate timeline will low latency
    . A new posts should be broadcasted with low latency to all its connecting users
    
 3) Capacity estimations?
  Assuming a user has 300 friends average and 200 pages to be followed
  
  Traffic estimates?
    We have 300 M daily active users
    Each user fetches it's timeline 5 times a day
    
    300 Million users * 5 times a day = 1.5 Billion request per day or 17500 request per second
    
    
  Storage estimates?
    We want to store 500 latest news feed to quick fetch.
    Each post size is 1Kb. This means we 
      500 new feed per user * 1KB = 500 KB data per user
      
      
    Total active users - 300 M
    300 Million * 500 KB = 150 TB of memory 
    Note: if a server holds 100 Gb then we need 1500 such machines to store the data
    
    
  4) System API?
    getUserFeed(apiDevKey, userId, lastFeedID, count, maxID, exludeReplies) 
    
    Parameters:
api_dev_key (string): 
  The API developer key of a registered account. This can be used to, among other things, throttle users based on their allocated quota.
user_id (number): The ID of the user for whom the system will generate the newsfeed.
lastFeedID (number): Optional; returns results with an ID higher than (that is, more recent than) the specified ID.
count (number): Optional; specifies the number of feed items to try and retrieve, up to a maximum of 200 per distinct request.
max_id (number): Optional; returns results with an ID less than (that is, older than) or equal to the specified ID.
exclude_replies(boolean): Optional; this parameter will prevent replies from appearing in the returned timeline.

Returns: (JSON) Returns a JSON object containing a list of feed items.
    
5) Database design?
  . User
  . Entity
  . FeedItem
  . Media

Relationship tables:
  . UserFollow
  . FeedMedia

  Some observations between these entities

. A user can follow other entities
. User and entities can post the feed items which contains text and other multimedia type
. Each feed item has associated userId or Entity ID that owns the posts


6) High level system design?
