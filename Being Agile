PSI - potentially shippable increment
Agile is 
  - Iterative delivery
  - Incremental delivery
  
Vertical sclicing is important

--------------- Roles ---------------------

Scrum Master-
  - process owners
  - problem solver [impediments]
  - protector [from external disturbance]
Dev teams
PO

-------------- Artifacts --------------------
Product backlog - high level requiements (it is versioned documents) 
   PO owns the documents

Sprint backlog - subset of product backlog, that should target what to develop in current sprint
  - Spring backlog is not versioned
  - it is divided into multiple tasks that would be completed in each sprint
  
PSI - potentially shippable increment

--------------- Ceremonies -----------------
Sprint planning meeting - The input should be product backlog[a backlog should be priortized]
  PO, Dev teams, Scrum master
  Output: Sprint backlog
  Scrum master is responsible timelines
  Time duration: 4 hours in two week sprint
  
Review meeting - Demo with the PO and customer
  2 hours 
  PO, Dev team, scrum master
  Dev team will give the demo
  All the reviews will be added to Product backlog

Retrospective meeting - To update the processes, improvements
  2 hours 
  only this has a MoM
  PO, Scrum master, Dev teams

Product backlog grooming - Details, repriortize 
  - Input : product backlog grooming
  Sprinting a head sessions
  Furnish the Product backlog

Daily scrum meeting - daily update meeting
  15 minutes standup
  What did we do?
  What is planned?
  What are impediments?
  Scrum master and Dev team are required
  PO are optional
  
 
Sprint#0-
  Vision of the product
  Creation of product backlog and priortization   | User story workshop
  Estimation of user stories                      | User story workshop
  
  Release date computation
  Agile orientation
  Base architecture
  High level infrastructure and enviroment setup
  PoC and framework for application development and testing
  
  Sprint 1...n
  
** User stories came from eXtreme Programming
  
1)  Format: 
  As a <TYPE_OF_USER>, I want <GOALS> so that <REASON>
  
  Example:
  As an Admin, I want to the page access to be restricted based on role, so that 
  only authenticated user
  
2) Acceptance criteria:

INVEST - Independent Negotiable Valuable Estimable Small Testable

Priortization Of U.S. - [1-n with 1 being the highest priority]
  - Feature urgency [Owners PO]
   a) MoSCoW - Must to Have, Should have, Could have, Won't have features
  - Business Values
  - Risks involved - [H,M,L] -> Depends on Risk (Priority can be high for High risk or low risk activities)
  - Dependency

********************************  
  
Estimation of U.S.
  Baseline depends on the team members
  In sprint0 - baseline is decided
  
  - Quantum of Work
  - Risks, uncertanities involved
  - Experience?

  a) Fibbonacci series (considers the complexity for bigger stories)

? - Clarity required
INFINITE - Epics

Planning Poker activity - to come to consensus for estimation


-------------------------------
What impacts the computation of Sprint duration?
  - 
  
Velocity - Story points completed in a sprint
  Story points shouldn't change but velocity will increase with exp.
  
Guess velocity during sprint0 
  - Prior exp. 
  - Historical data
  
---------------------------------

Calculate Release date-
  Guessed velocity - 10 velocity
  Product backlog =  100
  Sprint length - 2 week
  
  Release date -
     Est. sprints required = 100/10 = 10 sprints
	 
	 Total weeks = 10 sprints * 2 weeks per sprint = 20 weeks
	 
	 10% of Total weeks - Uncertanity - 2 weeks
	 15% of Total weeks - Rework and improvements - 3 weeks
     1 Hardening sprint - 2 weeks or 1 sprint     - 2 weeks
	 
	 Total = 27 weeks (the actual release date for this project)

---------------------

Estimation statistics  -

  a) Release burn down:
     Story points on Y-axis and Number of Sprints on X-axis
     
	 Idea burn down chart is available in sprint0
     whereas, the actual burn down is created in sprints
	 
  b) Sprint burn down:
     Total hours of efforts remaining Y-axis and days on X-axis 
     
	 Why hours and not story points on Y-axis - 
	    because DoD says story is complete only when all taks associated to story are complete
		The graph would be a step graph.
  
  c) Sprint burn up chart:
	Total hours of efforts spent Y-axis and days on X-axis 
	
  
  Sprint0 - Capacity planned, Priority User stories, total story points to burn down?
  
  
======================

Issue with Agile or Scaled scrum-
  
Distributed Scrum - teams is not co-located, but face to face conversation
Staggled sprinting -
