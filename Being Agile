PSI - potentially shippable increment
Agile is 
  - Iterative delivery
  - Incremental delivery
  
Vertical sclicing is important

--------------- Roles ---------------------

Scrum Master-
  - process owners
  - problem solver [impediments]
  - protector [from external disturbance]
Dev teams
PO

-------------- Artifacts --------------------
Product backlog - high level requiements (it is versioned documents) 
   PO owns the documents

Sprint backlog - subset of product backlog, that should target what to develop in current sprint
  - Spring backlog is not versioned
  - it is divided into multiple tasks that would be completed in each sprint
  
PSI - potentially shippable increment

  Example:
  As an Admin, I want to the page access to be restricted based on role, so that

INVEST - Independent Negotiable Valuable Estimable Small Testable

Priortization Of U.S. - [1-n with 1 being the highest priority]
  - Feature urgency [Owners PO]
   a) MoSCoW - Must to Have, Should have, Could have, Won't have features
  - Business Values
  - Risks involved - [H,M,L] -> 
  - Dependency

********************************  
  
Estimation of U.S.
  Baseline depends on the team members
  In sprint0 - baseline is decided
  
  - Quantum of Work
  - Risks, uncertanities involved
  - Experience?

  a) Fibbonacci series (considers the complexity for bigger stories)

? - Clarity required
INFINITE - Epics

Planning Poker activity - to come to consensus for estimation
