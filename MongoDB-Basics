Compass - a Mongo UI

Database -> Collections -> Documents -> Fields


Filter fields in MongoDB - 
  1. Quality filters = {"key" : "value"}
  2. Range = {"key" : {"$gte" : value1, "$lt" : value2 } }    // Used operators
  3. Nested JSON = {"key" : {"$gte" : value1, "$lt" : value2 } }
  4. GeoSpatial = {"key" : {"$geoWithIn" : [[x,y], radiusInRadians] }}

-------------------

To show avaialble database
show dbs

Use available database
use <COLLECTION_NAME>

View data in collections
db.<Collection_name>.find()

Pretty print the data
View data in collections
db.<Collection_name>.find().pretty()

it <for the next page of data>


-------------------
Data types - 

int32
int64
Double
Decimal128
String
Object 
Array
-------------------

load("FILE_NAME") - to load the contents of file in the clusture

db.<Collection_NAME>.
insertOne() --- It accepts a String/JSON as an argument, that represents document
  
  Response - 
    1) acknowledged - the Document is interted successfully or not
    2) insertedId - ObjectId("...") - The ID representing this document


if _id is present in the document, then insertedID will represent the supplied _id else Mongo DB will create _id for supplied document


3) insertMany([...]) - An array of Documents will be supplied to be inserted in Collection

  ** It is fail fast insert, as soon as the document has been inserted in the collection 
   any failure will result in stopped insertion
   
 To Change the default behavior- 
 
 3b) insertMany([...], {"ordered": false})
       Ordered key - false says, it will skip if _id field or Duplicate error is there 

-------------------

Sub document -
  "documentKey.subdocumentKey"

2) Quality matches - Match Arrays - (Full match)

 { "documentKey" : ["value1", "value2"] }

 or 
 
 {"documentKey" : "value1"} - Only single value but present in all the documents either inside array 

3) Index based search in array
 { "documentKey.0" : "value1"}

4) 


-------------------

it command in the Shell (default: 20 results for mongo shell)

find method returns cursor to the resultset
The result is returned are returned in batches
Cursors are iterated to view the results

-------------------

Mongo Projections - reduce the network overhead and processing requirements
  - Projection is a second argument to the default method.

  find({...}, {"Key" : 1})

Here "Key" shows the what all Objects/Keys to be retrieved from the Collection.
Note: It also returns the _id column from the Collections, unless explicitly exclude it.

Here Value : 1 specifies that field to be included in Projection whereas 0 says exclude it

-------------------

Updating Documents in Mongo DB

1) db.<Collection_Name>.updateOne( {"FILTER_KEY" : "VALUE"}, {$set: { "updateKey" : "updateValue"}} )

Operators:
a) $set - takes document as an argument, all Key/value pairs reflect in new version of document to be updated

Response- 
acknowledged - true  // The command is succesful
matchedCount - 1 // Total filter match count
modifiedCount - 1 // Number of document modified (should be 0 or 1 as we're using updateOne)


b) $unset - remove the specified field from the Collection
c) $min - if specified value is greater than existing field value
d) $max - if specified value is smaller than existing field value
e) $currentDate - Sets the value of field to current date, either as Date or timestamps
