CouchBase lite - A DB for low memory or mobile devices with the same features as CouchBase Server

---------------------------
How CouchBase stores the data?

CouchBase allows a 25 byte Key - with ~250 UTF-8 charachters
Value - upto 20Mb, 5M to 20M UTF-8 characters

---------------------------
CouchBase Node - an instance hosting CouchBase server
Cluster - One/more nodes sharing data across distributed Buckets
Bucket - Keyspace of uniquly keyed components, 
Document- Unique key-value pair stored in bucket (e.g. a JSON model)
---------------------------

CouchBase scaling capabilities?
 * All the services (data, Query, Search, Index, Event processing, Analytics) can be hosted over each node
 * Any of service can be deployed on single node in clusture
 * Any of service can be scaled as per requirements [Horizontal or Veritical]
