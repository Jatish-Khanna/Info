CouchBase Scalable services in each Node-
  Key-Value or Data: Data storage and replication
  N1QL - Query : Query planning and Optimization
  Search : Full text search, Index replication, Natural language querying
  Indexing : Global secondary search
  Event processing : Handlers to be triggered on any Operation or event e.g.  Propagte changes to Other nodes
  Computational intense analytical queries : Workload distribution in clusture, Batched queries
  
  Cache and Storage for each Service
  Clusture Manager
  
CouchBase lite - A DB for low memory or mobile devices with the same features as CouchBase Server

---------------------------
How CouchBase stores the data?

CouchBase allows a 25 byte Key - with ~250 UTF-8 charachters
Value - upto 20Mb, 5M to 20M UTF-8 characters

---------------------------
CouchBase Node - an instance hosting CouchBase server
Cluster - One/more nodes sharing data across distributed Buckets
Bucket - Keyspace of uniquly keyed components, 
Document- Unique key-value pair stored in bucket (e.g. a JSON model)
---------------------------

CouchBase scaling capabilities?
 * All the services (data, Query, Search, Index, Event processing, Analytics) can be hosted over each node
 * Any of service can be deployed on single node in clusture
 * Any of service can be scaled as per requirements [Horizontal or Veritical]

---------------------------
What Data CouchBase service can do ?

 1. Data storage
 2. Caching - in-memory caching for high throughput
 3. Persistent Queue - to flow data from Cache#2 to Storage#1
 4. In-Clusture replication Queue - to replicate on nodes in clusture
 5. XDCR - Cross Data Center Replication Queue 
 
 Note: Queues are shared, multi-thread pools

---------------------------
Caching in CouchBase?
  Full - The Key-Value pair will be cached
  Value-Only i.e. Key remains Cached and valued will be loaded from Storage

---------------------------
Data from the Application ---> CouchBase Cache --> Persistent Queue 
                                                                ||
                                                                \/
          In-Cluster Replication <--- CouchBase Node storage <---
                                                ||
                                                \/
                                         XDCR Queue for Datacenter replication
                                         
---------------------------

Aggregate Views in CouchBase?
  - A secondary index has been generated on Each CouchBase node
  - Indexes are avaiable on REST service
  
---------------------------
CouchBase Data buckets-
  A bucket is a set of uniquely keyed Documents[Keyspaces]
  Source of data for query, index, shadow data sets for Analytics, Events
  
  : Compare to a Database in Releational database
  : Values are structured in JSON 
  : Rows in RDBMS, document in CouchBase
  : Schema is not enforced in CouchBase
  : 10 Buckets per clusture
 
 1. Perform Caching and Persistence
 2. Replication
 3. Rebalancing on node failover or addidtions
 
 Types of Buckets CouchBase supports?
 1. CouchBase - Persisted data and querable
 2. Ephemeral - KeyValue data not persisted but can be queried
 3. Memcached - binary cache


Note: Databucket is a logical Keyspace

vBuckets -  A datasegment on each node
  - Each Bucket in CouchBase is divided into 1024 vBuckets, evenly distributed across nodes in clusture
  - vBucket are rebalancing on changes in number of nodes

---------------------------
CouchBase ?
  1. RPO - Recovery point Objective (Maximum permissible data loss)
  2. RTO - Recovery Time Objective (Time to get back Online, with data to your RPO)

HA - High Availablity
  Rack-Zone aware replication
  XDCR (Cross Data center Replication)
  Appending/Removing nodes from Clusture
  Resillient application design

DR - Disaster recovery
  XDCR 
  BackUp and Restoration
  
Case#1 A node failed
  . Replicas Promoted as master to serve request
  . Updated clusture map is broadcasted
  
  . Configure a new node and add to clusture with Zero-downtime
  . Data stream proportional to new node
  . Updated clusture map sent to clients

Case#2 - A complete rack lost

  . RackZone awareness replication 
  . Replicas promoted on all the nodes lost
  . Zero downtime to add new nodes and rack
  . Update clusture maps
  
  
Case#3 Datacenter failure

  . XDCR - Cross data center replication


---------------------------
Issues with RDBMS?
 1. Hardware problems - as they opt for scale up but scale out
 2. Data modeling - Tables have impedence mismatch with real world data (A complex Object to be represented as row)
 3. Fixed Schema - Future and changing needs 
 4. Premium h/w
 5. SPoF
 6. Scale issue
 7. Upgrade isses

---------------------------
What is Expected of E-DBMS (Engaged Database systems i.e. NoSQL)

 1. Elastic Architecture or schema
 2. In-memory storage
 3. Query & indexing
 4. Mobile and offline sync
 5. Search and Indexing
 6. Integrated Analytics
 7. Scaling
 8. Replication and Resillient
 9. Caching
 10. API definitions
 ...
 
--------------------------- 
 Best Practice to Data modelling -
   1. When you might embed : Atomic right of set of data, where Data and Cardinality are small
   
   2. When you refer - From One document to Other?
    Common data shared across keys e.g. Multiple Students enrolled same course
    Data and Cardinality are large
    Data set is updated frequently
 
--------------------------- 
Normalization Benefits-
  . Minimal data inconsistencies
  . Reduced update costs
  . Preserve storage resources
  
Denormalization benefits-
  . Data model can be optimized 
  . Duplicate data tradeoff, increases access speed
  . Support Clustured architecture, reduce server overhead and Costs for premium s/w h/w systems
