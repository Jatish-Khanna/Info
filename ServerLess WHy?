Benefits of Serverless-

1. No server or underlined infrastructure management:No need to install, maintain, administer, any software or runtime
2. Flexible Scaling: Easy application scaling and automatic scaling options
3. Availability: High availability and fault tolerant capacity

4. Speed up the process of cloud Native applications
  - Cloud native applications are used to automate and integrate the concepts of -
  . Microservices - Architectural approaoch for developing an application as collection of small services
