@RestControllerAdvice is just a syntactic sugar for @ControllerAdvice + @ResponseBody, you can look here.

Is it we should always use @RestControllerAdvice for rest services and @ControllerAdvice MVC?

Again, as mentioned above, 
@ControllerAdvice can be used even for REST web services as well, but you need to additionally use @ResponseBody.
