Different application integration styles?
 1. Shared database
 2. RPC, SOAP or REST call to the other service
 3. Middleware between to services
 4. Data feeds with ETL, Extracting the data from one system, transforming and loading into the other system
 
Issues?
 1. Shared database?
   a) Hit with performance bottlenecks and scalability issue esp. with SQL databases
   b) SPoF for all the services if database goes down
   c) Upgrades or Adjustments to the system for one application will have side effects on the other systems
   d) Tight copuling and back compatability, i.e. all systems must upgrade at sametime if not compatible
   e) Concurrency and timing issues in the shared system
   
 2) RPC calls between the systems?
   a) JSON or XML data exchange between different services
   b) Require software loadbalancer, registration and lookup service like Eureka
   c) Can independently scale different components
   d) require circuit breaker and fallback patterns 
   e) more concerns of the cascading failures in the system
 
 3) Messaging middleware between componenets?
   a) Aysnc over synchronous communication
