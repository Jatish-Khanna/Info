Let's design a video sharing service like Youtube, where users will be able to upload/view/search videos.

1) Why Youtube?
Youtube is one of the most popular video sharing websites in the world.
 Users of the service can upload, view, share, rate, and report videos as well as add comments on videos.

2) Requirements and Goals of the System

Functional requirements:
  . Users should be able to upload the videos on the server
  . Users should be able to view the videos uploaded
  . Users should be ablt to search the videos
  . Service should be able to track the status of Like/comments/Views
  . Add the comments or view a comments for videos
  
Non-functional requirements:
  . The system should be highly reliable that the uploaded video should not be lost
  . The service should be highly available 
  . The consistency can be eventual, it may take some time to view the uploaded video
  . The buffering of video should be modular and proper without any pauses
  
3) Capacity estimations and constaraints?
  Total number of system users?   2 billion
  Total number of daily active users? 800 Million
  Number of reads per day?  5 per day by single user
  Read:write average? 200 : 1 i.e. per 200 reads, one video is uploaded
  Number of writes per day? 
  
  Average size per file? 1 minute video of size 50 MB
  
  What is total views per second?
  800 M (daily active users) * 5 / 86400 = 46,000 views per second
  
  What is the total number of uploads per day?
    800 M (DAU) * 5 (number of views per user per day) / 200 (read :write ratio) =  230 videos per second
    
  A) Storage estimates?
      Assume every every minute 500 hours of worth video has been uploaded by users
      If average video of 1 minutes takes 50 MB, then total storage of videos per minute is as-
  
      50 MB * (500 * 60 ) minutes = 1500 Gb/minutes = 25Gb/sec
      
      Note: these numbers doesn't include replication and without video compression
