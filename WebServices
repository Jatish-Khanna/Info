A software system that is designed to support inter-communication over network

 - These services mostly communicate over HTTP
 - These services can be running on diverse s/w and h/w platforms
 - Main benefits include interoperatibility and extensibility 
 - It could be component or an aggregator in the E2E request flow
 - It supports Single Responsibility and reusability
 
 
 Webservices-
 
 . SOA - Service Oriented Architecture (designed, developed and accessed using standards) 
  - usually uses SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
   It is a strongly types messaging framework that relies on XML and schemas
 
 1. SOAP based services-
    a) Discovered - UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration) - is a registration services to register/discover
    b) Described - WSDL (Web service description language) written in XML
    c) Accessed - SOAP - An XML template that defines information exchange and message format
    
    All supported by XML schemas
  
 2. ReSTful - Representational state transfer ()
  Requesting a resource over web does mean either 
    . Retrieve the current state of an Object
    . Retrieve the update state of an Object by proposing change (update, delete)
    
    
SOAP and ReST - both provides the support to access resources over n/w

 . SOAP is a protocol that defines that message exhange definition i.e. Describe and Access over n/w
 . REST is an architecture that access resource over n/w using HTTP

 . SOAP can utilize other layers like transport (SMTP, FTP ...)
 . REST is based on HTTP
 
 . SOAP - Request from client has an additional overhead of processing at client and server
 . REST - Can directly send data, no need to wrap any data 
 
 . Service contract is defined using WSDL
 . REST - Service contract can be defined using WADL (Web Application Description Language) only if required
