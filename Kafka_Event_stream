kafka-
  A database that is storing, processing, and reacting infinte streams of data
  
  1. Like Hadoop - but Kafka stores continuous stream 
    whereas Hadoop stores big-batch of the files and process them on scheduled batches
    
  2. Enterprise Messaging - It is unified,elastic, cloud ready and modelled on distributed foundation systems
      
  3. Evolution of ETL and intergration-
    Any channels of input can source data/event to Kafka
    
    
    Example -
      A self driving car - ingress data from different cameras and sensors
       egress - the predictive actions
