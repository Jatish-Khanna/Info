kafka-
  A database that is storing, processing, and reacting infinte streams of data
  
  1. Like Hadoop - but Kafka stores continuous stream 
    whereas Hadoop stores big-batch of the files and process them on scheduled batches
    
  2. Enterprise Messaging - It is unified,elastic, cloud ready and modelled on distributed foundation systems
      
  3. Evolution of ETL and intergration-
    Any channels of input can source data/event to Kafka
    
    
    Example -
      A self driving car - ingress data from different cameras and sensors
       egress - the predictive actions
       
      
  Kafka considers each action as event and such we have stream of events
  
       
-----------------
Application to Cloud-
  Rather than having point to point connections b/w the public and on-premise cloud
  we have a bridge as a Kafka that publishes the streams on both sides
  
  . This helps in maintaining
  . Sync data
  . All this is real-time as part of event stream
  . Scalable with Kafka clustures
  . Huge storage as if connection is down or backpressure to be implemented
