Ways to sync between players

A) Deterministic Lock step

  1) TCP X
  2) Playout buffer - Save all the packets from multiple online clients in the buffer
    . This will add gitter/delay once packet received
    . This is based on TCP - if the packet is dropped or late, client need to resend the packet
    . Resending will add lot of delay 


    Options:
    a) UCD? unreliable and connectionless protocol
      .
      
  Note: any delay or problems in one sync will impact complete stream
  
B) State Synchronization-
  This is to resolve sync the state of object (Position, linear velocity, angular velocity, orientation...)
  The bandwidth required is in Kb/s and Mb/s
  
  - This solution does have a jitter issues,  and polarization can be used to predict the state of object
  
  We have state machines for each object example - A player is jumping and then what are the next possible states
  
  
 C) State Machine pattern: it allows us to implement state machines using OOP
  . Every state mainitains a class
  . Deligate a state
