A sample query -
  {
    book {
      title
      author {
        name
        books {
          title
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  Instead of sending multiple request from UI, client can be flexible enough to request what is required from the backend

Important tools:
  Apollo - 
  GraphQL server - A backend server that handles the GraphQL request
  GraphiQL - A dummy frontend application that allows to test and make request to backend like Postman
