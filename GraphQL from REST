A sample query -
  {
    book {
      title
      author {
        name
        books {
          title
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  Instead of sending multiple request from UI, client can be flexible enough to request what is required from the backend

Important tools:
  Apollo - A graph QL client
  GraphQL server - A backend server that handles the GraphQL request
  GraphiQL - A dummy frontend application that allows to test and make request to backend like Postman


Apollo - Much like HTTP request for RESTful clients, similarlly a frontend app can use GraphQL client to interact with Graph server
