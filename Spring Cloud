Spring cloud K8s Config map

spring:
  application:
    name: cloud-k8s-app
  cloud:
    kubernetes:
      config:
        name: default-name
        namespace: default-namespace
        sources:
         # Spring Cloud Kubernetes will lookup a ConfigMap named c1 in namespace default-namespace
         - name: c1
         # Spring Cloud Kubernetes will lookup a ConfigMap named default-name in whatever namespace n2
         - namespace: n2
         # Spring Cloud Kubernetes will lookup a ConfigMap named c3 in namespace n3
         - namespace: n3
           name: c3


In the example above, it spring.cloud.kubernetes.config.namespace had not been set, 
then the ConfigMap named c1 would be looked up in the namespace that the application runs

Any matching ConfigMap that is found, will be processed as follows:

apply individual configuration properties.
apply as yaml the content of any property named application.yaml
apply as properties file the content of any property named application.properties


If both profiles are active, the property which appears last within the configmap will overwrite preceding values.
