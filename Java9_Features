The most important feature Java 9 has brought into market is "Modularization"

Java platform updates-
  Module System 
  JShell
  
Library Features-
  New factory methods in Collections framework
  Stream API enhancements
  Process API
  HTTP/2.0
  Compact Strings
  Enhancement of @Deprecated annotation
  
  
Java language Features-
  New try-with resources
  Private methods in interfaces
  @SafeVarargs on private instance methods
  Diamond Operator with Anonymous classes
  
JVM -
  Garbage collection
  
  =======================
  JPMS - Java platform module system
    * JDK/JRE the rt.jar is too big for the modern day infrastructure like IoT devices
    * Weak encapsulation?
      A package exposes all its public types to other packages and no way to prevent the global visibility
      No encapsulation above the packages, not even by Jars 
    
    
   Actual specification from JSRs
   1. JEP 261 - Create a module system for the language
   2. JEP 220 - Update the runtime to support modularity
   3. JEP 201 - Modularize JDK source
   4. JEP 200 - Modularize the JDK libs
   5. JEP 260 - Encapsulate most internal API's 
   6. JEP 282 - Create smaller runtime with subset of modules from JDK
   
   
   Why modularity?
   * Ease of support of runtime for different h/ws
   * Maintenance and reusability 
   * Improved performance, startup time and memory usage of applications
   
   Platform modules-
     1. Standard modules -
       The name of these modules starts with java.*
       These are supported and intended to be used by developers
       
       
       Example-
       java.rmi.*
       java.log.*
     
     2. Non-standard modules - 
       The name of these modules start with jdk.*
       Non-standard modules contain packages and specific JDK code, distinct b/w implementations of JDK
       
   How to identify and describes the modules?
     java --listmodules
     java --describe-module <MODULE_NAME>
