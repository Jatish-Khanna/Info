That automates the deployment of application inside s/w containers

1. Docker Registry
2. Docker Host
3. Docker Client
4. Images

Docker Commands
docker pull
docker serach
docker run
docker build
docker ps
docker ls

Proxy:
docker login <USER_NAME>


Dockerfile:

FROM <BASE_IMAGE_FROM_REGISTRY>
COPY SOURCE DEST
EXPOSE PORT_NUMBER
CMD ["COMMAND", "PARAMETERS", ...]



Remove all the stopped containers:

docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)


docker secret ls
docker secret inspect <secret_name>
echo "VALUE" | docker create <secret_name> -

docker compose 
  environment:
    - VARIABLE=DOCKER-SECRET-><secret_name>
  secrets:
    - <secret_name>
secrets:
  <secret_name>:
    external: true

====================================

Docker compose is best suited if all the services to be started on single Host, 
  For Cluster or services to start as distributed application stack ->
    1) Docker swarm
    2) K8s - Kubernetes

==================================

Docker-compose
  1) Version:1 
     No support for networking other than "Brigde n/w" and use links to enable communcation b/w the components
     No support for depends_on i.e. application sequence to start with
     
  2) Version:2
     All the services should be declared in service: section
     version: 2 must be specified at the top of file
     A dedicated n/w for all the services and then attach all the services to this single n/w to enable networking support     
     depends_on feature to define the sequence of application startup
     
  3) Version 3:
     version: 2 + other features i.e. version: 3
     it supports docker swarm and docker stacks
     
  
  Note: Each service can be attached to multiple n/ws example - DBs can be attached to backend n/w whereas Webapps to frontend
    but Backend API should be attached to both front and backend networks
  
 ==================================
 
 docker pull redis is equivalent to docker pull redis/redis where redis is the Useraccount/repository of the docker registry
  
  Private registry:
    docker login registry.my.org
    
    docker pull registry.my.org/repository/image
  
  ================================
  
  Setup a docker registry:
    docker run -p 5000:5000 -name=registry registry:2
    
    docker image tag my-app localhost:5000/my-app   // Create a new tag for image 
    docker push localhost:5000/my-app
