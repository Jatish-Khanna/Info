To get the latest tweet from all the users?
 Fan out -> but it has issues with person who have high number of followers
  The approach is called as fanout approach which is asynchronous
  When we get a tweet
  Process the message
  send it to all the users
  This entry will be stored in redis list of all the followers
  
  Follower logins and read all the tweets from redis list
