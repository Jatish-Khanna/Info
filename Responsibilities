Architecture Envisioning
 Iteration Modeling
 Model Storming
 Test First Design
 Code Refactoring
 Continuous Integration

Architecture envisioning happens during the initiation phase of Agile development. 
The iteration modeling can be done at the beginning of the Sprint as part of Sprint planning to finalize the strategy for the Sprint. 
Similarly, model storming can be done with the team members for providing the solution approach just before the development. 
Also, code refactoring can be done to make the application scalable to incorporate new requirements.


Continuous Integration has reformed how companies look at 
  Build and Configuration Management, 
  Release Management, 
  Deployment Automation and 
  Test Orchestration.

Agile does not recommend lot of analysis and research rather focuses on inspect-and-adapt process
It emphasizes more on creating POC (Proof of Concept)


1) Sprint planning
2) Design build and Unit test
3) Code integration
4) Functional and regression test
5) Intermediate reviews by client
6) User demo
7) Retrospective

Clean code that works’. 
TDD helps to design and develop the code in a predictable way by writing only code just enough to make the test cases pass.


Unit Test should be written as Standard (No exceptions)
 80% Line coverage/85% branch Coverage (On new code/No exceptions)


Hudson Server Used as a CI server

ANT
For automation using Ant scripts Checkstyle To check adherence to coding standards

Findbugs
Static code analysis tool. This is used to detect wide range of problems 
by analyzing the Java byte code 

PMD It scans the source code and further looks for 
potential problems, possible bugs, unused code, complicated expressions and duplicate code

Jdepend
Java package dependency analyzer which generates design quality metrics 

Cobertura Code coverage tool. 
It is used for Java code coverage analysis

Junit
Java’s unit testing framework
