Anisble doesn't need any agents running on nodes/servers. It does complete activity over SSH and User accounts to login on

1) Ansible control server -
    Central control server which executes and controls the playbooks
    apt-get install ansible
    
    ansible --version
    
    Update the ansible.cfg to start with Ansible:
    inventory   = [defines the hosts file to locate hosts over the n/w]
    sudo_user =   [the user with which ansible will do the ssh and run the playbooks]

Setup an Inventory: (logical groups or nodes)
    Ansible hosts which defines the DNS alias called as Ansible hosts. These hosts defines where Ansible can run playbooks
    
     The user should have sudo privilege and should not ask for password at the time of SSH
     Even to local host Ansible requires ssh-copy-id, while treating localhost as node

2) Ansible playbooks-

A single Ansible command not yet playbook

    Run on logical groups or all (a defined keyword)
    Example
    anisble all -m  ping

    Structure of ansible
    The basic syntax consists of "ansible" then the "host group" from hosts to run against, 
    -m <MODULE_NAME>, and 
    optionally providing arguments via -a "OPT_ARGS"

    -s <specify the module to be executed as sudo on remote systems>
