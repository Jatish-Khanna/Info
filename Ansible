Anisble doesn't need any agents running on nodes/servers. It does complete activity over SSH and User accounts to login on

1) Ansible control server -
    Central control server which executes and controls the playbooks
    apt-get install ansible
    
    ansible --version
    
    Update the ansible.cfg to start with Ansible:
    inventory   = [defines the hosts file to locate hosts over the n/w]
    sudo_user =   [the user with which ansible will do the ssh and run the playbooks]
    
    Ansible hosts which defines the DNS alias called as Ansible hosts. These hosts defines where Ansible can run playbooks
    
     The user should have sudo privilege and should not ask for password at the time of SSH
     Even to local host Ansible requires ssh-copy-id, while treating localhost as node
