Configuration Management
Deployment management
Orchestration


Anisble doesn't need any agents running on nodes/servers. It does complete activity over SSH and User accounts to login on

1) Ansible control server -
    Central control server which executes and controls the playbooks
    apt-get install ansible
    
    ansible --version
    
    Update the ansible.cfg to start with Ansible:
    inventory   = [defines the hosts file to locate hosts over the n/w]
    sudo_user =   [the user with which ansible will do the ssh and run the playbooks]

Setup an Inventory: (logical groups or nodes)
    Ansible hosts which defines the DNS alias called as Ansible hosts. These hosts defines where Ansible can run playbooks
    
     The user should have sudo privilege and should not ask for password at the time of SSH
     Even to local host Ansible requires ssh-copy-id, while treating localhost as node

2) Ansible playbooks-

A single Ansible command not yet playbook

    Run on logical groups or all (a defined keyword)
    Example
    anisble all -m  ping

    Structure of ansible
    The basic syntax consists of "ansible" then the "host group" from hosts to run against, 
    -m <MODULE_NAME>, and 
    optionally providing arguments via -a "OPT_ARGS"

    -s <specify the module to be executed as sudo on remote systems>


  Playbook format-
  
  A sample playbook
  
    test.yml
        --- # This is test YAML example to install module on server
        - hosts: <server/group>
          remote_user: <ansible>
          become: yes
          become_method: sudo
          connection: ssh
          gather_facts: yes
          vars:
            user_name: jatish
          tasks:
          - name: Install module on node
            yum:
              name: httpd
              state: latest
            notify:
            - startservice
            handlers:
            - name: startservice
              service:
                name: httpd
                state: restarted
                
                
=======================
How to run above playbook
  ansible-playbook test.yml
                
                
Ansible variables: '{{ keyword }}'

#Method-1::

    test.yml
        --- # This is test YAML example to install module on server
        - hosts: '{{ hostnames }}'
          remote_user: '{{ remote_user }}'
          become: yes
          become_method: sudo
          connection: ssh
          gather_facts: yes
          vars:
            remote_user: jatish
            hostnames: <hostname>
          tasks:
          - name: Install module on node
            yum:
              name: httpd
              state: latest
            notify:
            - startservice
            handlers:
            - name: startservice
              service:
                name: httpd
                state: restarted
                
            
    How to substitute values in variable in the "vars" sections


#Method-2::

Substitute using ansible command line-
    ansible-playbook test.yml --extra-vars "hostnames=<hostname> remote_user=jatish"
