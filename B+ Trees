B+ trees is an extension of B trees. It allows efficient operations-
  - Insertion
  - Deletion
  - Search 
  
The records are stored at leaf nodes
The keys are stored as internal nodes

  How search is efficient -
    All leaf nodes are linked together as single LinkedList, that makes search more efficient
    
  Note: B+ trees can store large datasets which may not fit into PRIMARY memory
    Redundant search keys can be present in B+ trees
    Deletion in B+ tree is easy compared to B trees where data nodes are only stored at leaf
 
These are optimized as to store -- 
  Keys in the main memory and records in the secondary storage
  
Good things- 
  . Height of tree remain balanced
  . B+ trees allows data access sequentionally (all leafs are linked as single List) and direct access
  . Keys are used for indexing optimize faster reads
