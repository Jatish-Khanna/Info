 
 Redis’ in-memory database is an almost perfect fit for use-cases where short-lived messages and persistence aren’t required. 
 
 On the other hand,
 Kafka is a high throughput distributed queue which is built for storing a large amount of data for longer periods of time.

Use Redis: (E.g. Slack IRC - where real-time sending is important)

Fire and forget system, the messages ingressed are delivered to consumers instantly
Speed is utmost important
Data reliability isn't important or data loss is bearable
Persistant is not important, 
Message size are not huge

Use kafka: (IoT, distributed producers/consumer, parallelism, )
Data reliability is important, and messages can be retrieved even after consumption
Speed is not a big concern
Message size is huge
